# Day 1 – SRE vs DevOps vs Platform Engineering

## Hands-On: Role Comparison Exercise

## Step 1: Create a Role Comparison Table

Create a three-column table with the following column headers:

```
+------------------------+------------------------+------------------------------+
|         SRE            |        DevOps          |     Platform Engineering     |
+------------------------+------------------------+------------------------------+
```

This table will help you visually map responsibilities across the roles.

## Step 2: Add Example Tasks to Each Column

Use the following tasks to fill the table.

### SRE Tasks

* Define SLIs and SLOs.
* Respond to incidents and lead postmortems.
* Implement monitoring and alerting.
* Reduce operational toil.
* Improve system reliability.

### DevOps Tasks

* Manage CI/CD pipelines.
* Automate build and deployment processes.
* Maintain infrastructure scripts.
* Support development workflow automation.
* Ensure environment consistency.

### Platform Engineering Tasks

* Build internal developer platforms.
* Provide reusable infrastructure modules.
* Offer self-service tools.
* Standardise infrastructure patterns.
* Maintain platform performance and scalability.

Add these tasks into the table you created.

# Notes

* The purpose of this exercise is to help you distinguish role boundaries.
* This table will serve as a reference for later discussions on collaboration during incidents and releases.
