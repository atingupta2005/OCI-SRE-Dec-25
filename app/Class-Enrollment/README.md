## Tech Stack

**Backend:**
- Flask (Python web framework)
- Flask-Admin (admin interface)
- SQLAlchemy (ORM)
- SQLite (database)
- Flask-CORS (cross-origin support)

**Frontend:**
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Axios (HTTP client)

## Quick Start

### Backend Setup

1. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```

The server runs on `http://localhost:5000`
Flask-Admin interface: `http://localhost:5000/admin`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to client directory:
```bash
cd client
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app runs on `http://localhost:5173`

## Default Admin Account

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`

Use the Flask-Admin interface to create users and classes.

## Suggested Demo Flow

Follow this sequence to showcase all three roles:

1. **Admin role**
   - Log in as **`admin` / `admin123`**.
   - Show the **Admin Dashboard** in the React app.
   - Click **“Open Admin Panel”** to show Flask‑Admin at `http://localhost:5000/admin` and briefly demonstrate CRUD on users/classes/enrollments.

2. **Teacher role**
   - Click **Logout** to return to the login page.
   - Log in as **`ralph` / `teacher123`** (or another teacher).
   - Show the **Teacher Dashboard**:
     - “Your Courses” with the classes they teach.
     - Click a course to show the enrolled students and demonstrate **inline grade editing**.

3. **Student role**
   - Click **Logout** to return to the login page.
   - Log in as **`jose` / `student123`** (or another student).
   - Show the **Student Dashboard**:
     - “Your Courses” with current enrollments and grades.
     - “Available Courses” and demonstrate **enrollment** (capacity and duplicate protections).

## API Documentation

See `SETUP.md` for detailed API endpoint documentation.

## Validation Rules

1. **Enrollment Validation**:
   - Students cannot enroll in classes at capacity
   - Students cannot enroll in the same class twice

2. **Grade Editing**:
   - Only teachers can edit grades
   - Teachers can only edit grades for their own classes
   - Grades must be between 0-100 or null

3. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Students can only access student routes
   - Teachers can only access teacher routes
   - Admins have full access via Flask-Admin
